This website was created by a Brexit refugee and her Spanish partner in crime who kindly took her into his home to save her from being deported back to her home country.

### We love you Brexit Refugees!

Take a gander at our website for a collection of the most British things we found and what we are going to miss now that Great Britain has jumped (with no looking back) out of the European Union. We show you Brexit Refugees in Magaluf, Costa Del sol and Cornwall on holiday. There ain't no party like a British teenage, sex fest, fish and chip package party!
